To build, you'll need to change Makefile.common to point to
your copy of the solaris source.  Basically, everywhere it
says /wd320/max/onnv.111b/... should be changed to whereever
the source is on your machine.  If you don't have source,
you can get opensolaris and nevada source from www.opensolaris.org.

Also, this will build 32-bit x86.  For SPARC and x64, you'll need to add "-m64"
to the CFLAGS in Makefile.common.
